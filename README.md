#### Team Name - Impact Makers
#### Problem Statement - 3
#### Team Leader Email - suryakumars21cb@psnacet.edu.in

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  What is your solution? and how it works.
 The project aims to boost voter turnout on election day at polling stations by creating election awareness through an app.
The app will have four main features: creating election awareness songs, personalized posters, videos, and memes.
Users will receive reward points for sharing the awareness songs and posters on social media, watching the awareness videos, and seeing the memes.
The reward points can be redeemed for tea, coffee, or a sweet box.


## Code Execution Instruction:
  *[If your solution is **not** application based, you can ignore this para]
  
 We plan to work with the Election Commission of India to get their support and partnership to promote our app to the public. Once we access their voter database, we can send voting-related notifications to users.
